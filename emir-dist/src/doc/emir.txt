Introduction

The EMI Registry (EMIR) enables Grid services to be discovered in a DCI or a sub-domain of that DCI.
It does not provide a full description of that service, only the minimal 
set of information that is required to find more details about that service. 
In this sense it acts as a bootstrapping mechanism for the DCI. The EMIR has 
considered the concept of DCI management, for example, only services or sub-domains 
that are part of the DCI would be discovered. This implies that the EMIR enables 
implementation of the DCI's management policies. As DCIs are distributed and based on 
federated sub-domains, the EMI Registry must also reflect such a model.
