[NOTE]
.IMPORTANT NOTE ON PATHS
=========================================================
The location of the installation and configuration files differ 
depending on type of bundle (see the above section).

If RPM bundle is chosen, the following paths will be used:
  
  CONF=/etc/emi/emir
  BIN=/usr/sbin
  LOG=/var/log/emi/emir
  
The platform independent binary bundles all the files under
single directory. Thus if extracted:

  CONF=INST/conf
  BIN=INST/bin
  LOG=INST/logs
  
The above variables (CONF, BIN and LOG) will be used throughout the rest of this manual.
