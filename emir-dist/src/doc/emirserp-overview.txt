EMIR's Service Endpoint Record Publisher (EMIR-SERP) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UMD services need to be registered into the EMI Registry service
infrastructure to be discoverable for the clients. Most of the services
or even the containers executing them provide a way to do this but not
all of them. For those that are unable to register themselves
automatically and periodically the EMIR-SERP is available.

The EMIR-SERP is a daemon like (background) service that can be executed next to these
services (preferably on the same machine) and able to perform the
automatic and periodical registration and update against the
configured EMI Registry service on behalf of the service itself. This
client uses exactly the same, standard RESTful API as the other clients
do.

Most of the parameters of these registrations and updates can be
configured. For the details see the <<anchor-emir-serp-config,Configuration section>>!

After the successful registration until the termination of the daemon,
the EMIR-SERP client do the periodical updates then finally, when the execution of
the daemon is over, it attempts to delete the service entries from the
remote database.

The service entries can be defined in single files, in multiple files in
a watchdir (that is periodically scanned for new files) or in resource
BDIIs. 

The entries can contain any kind of information allowed and accepted by the EMI Regisrty
services and can be configured in the form of whole, formatted *json*
documents or LDAP in case of BDII usage. The LDIF -> JSON converson is
also performed by EMIR-SERP.
