Overview
--------

EMIR Server (DSR or GSR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EMI Service Registry is a Service Endpoint Registry conceived during the EMI project. Its main goal is to discover all the Service Endpoints that exist. 
It consists of a collection of services that enables storing service records in a federated manner. Each of the record is a Service Endpoint Record (SER) 
complying with the OGF's GLUE 2.0 standard. The deployment of EMIR (which implies building an EMIR network over WAN) is bipartite: 1) Building a rooted 
hierarchy with a single EMIR server aggregating all the information within a federation 2) Sharing the information at the root level among peered 
EMIR servers (using P2P), thus enabling intra-federation discovery.
 
   
Feature Highlights:

*	the service endpoint record registration includes the management of the services' endpoint information.
*	Powerful data back-end based on MongoDB
*	Schema-free information model based on JSON (using GLUE2 entity names for specific attributes)
*	REST-ful API to browse the service registrations
*	Security
**	PKI governed authentication
**	Policy based authorisation
