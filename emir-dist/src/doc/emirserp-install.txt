anchor:anchor-emir-serp-installation[]

The installation of the EMIR-SERP client is trivial. The only thing to do is
to install the +emir-serp+ package from the EMI repository by
executing:

`yum install emir-serp`

The package installation will provide the packages that are defined as
dependencies, like python, python-ldap and python-simplejson if they are
not previously installad on the machine.
