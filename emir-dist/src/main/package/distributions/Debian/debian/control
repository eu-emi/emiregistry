Description: A Service Registry conceived during the EMI project. 
 Its main goals to discover all the Service endpoints that 
 exist and hence obtain future information about them. The key 
 part to the service registry is the management procedures and 
 policies which it implements. These are dictated by the stakeholders 
 of the various infrastructures and have been implemented in the registry.
